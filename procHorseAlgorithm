## Algorithm for Procedural Horse Race

## data
```
make a constant int NUM_HORSES
make a constant int TRACK_LENGTH
```

# main()
```
make an array of 5 0 values, call it horses
set keepGoing as true

while keepGoing:
 run through each horse in array:
  advance that horse
  print that horse's lane
  if that horse won,
   set keepGoing to false
 ask user for input to start next turn
```
## advance()
```
 given a horse number and the array of horses
 roll a 0 or 1 value, put it into a coin
 add coin to the horse's position value in the array
```
## printLane()
```
given a horse number and the array of horses
loop from zero to TRACK_LENGTH
  if the current loop index is equal to the horse's value
    print the horse's id
  otherwise
    print a .
```
## isWinner()
```
result = false
given a horse number and the array of horses
if the current horse's value is equal to the TRACK_LENGTH
  result = true
  print "Horse {id} won!"
return result
